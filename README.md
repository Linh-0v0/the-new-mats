## About the Project
I've always wanted to try my hands on 3D model making. Now that I've finally got the time and chance to do it, with the help of the team, here is the final product.

Here's what we offer you:

* A 3D website stands out from any tranditional websites.
* The 3D model theme and topic is for you to decide, we'll make it happen üëå.
* A website that'll arise the customer's interest üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è.

This product which is made in the short time span, of course, still has things needed to be optimized. Thanks for taking your time visiting this project.
